# NetworkTheory
Network generation in Python
This is an assignment for the course of Network Theory in my University class. The project aims to generate and build a network using python's wikipedia module and networkx library.
There are 2 files in the repo. The code in python and the .gexf file generated and analyzed though Gephi. Gephi is the leading visualization and exploration software for all kinds of graphs and networks.
